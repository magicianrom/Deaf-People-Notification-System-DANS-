Jan 2024 - Feb 2024

Projects Purpose - The purpose is to help increase the safety of deaf drivers through designing a wearable which can notify deaf people of nearby sounds. Deaf drivers are unable to hear nearby vehicles or their honking sounds in case of an incident or emergencies.

Our Products Features
Visual Alert - The wearable has a set of three LEDs of different colors that light up based on the level of noise detected by a microphone. The louder the noise, the more LEDs that light up. 

Emergency Call - The wearable has an emergency call button, which if pressed would send a signal to notify a person that the user needs assistance. A separate device would receive that signal and display the ‘Help’ message.
